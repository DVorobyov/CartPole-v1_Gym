# Q-learning CartPole-v1
This is the program of learning agent from the game <b>"CartPole-v1"</b>, which is situated in the library called <b>"Gym"</b>. Reinforcement  learning, scilicet Q-learning algorithm, applied. Reinfocement learning is an area of machine learning. I used this algorithm to teach cart to balance by pole. This is how the field in CartPole-v1 looks like:

The graph of scores for the first 8000 games is presented below:

It is rather unstable because of random actions during the process of learning. Have a look at averaged scores for each 100 games:

Obviosly, after 4000 games the agent seems to be trained enough to get high results and the next games will slowly bring agent to the most 
optimal strategy during the learning.
